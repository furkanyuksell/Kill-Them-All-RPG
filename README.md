# Kill-Them-All-RPG

I developed a game for the project of my Java course during the early years of university, 5 years ago.
It was my first experience in game development when I was relatively new to programming. I didn't use any game engine, just pure java.

I created my own colliders within the game, and I was able to trigger the objects that interacted with them using invisible boxes.
I created my own animations by cutting my downloaded designs within the game.

I created animations by playing the images in a loop to show the movement of my character.

My character had 3 different abilities.

When the character used their skills, the skills went on cooldown and were prepared to be used again.

In the game, there were 2 different enemies, and when we entered a certain area, they would follow and attack us.

Their attack skills were web for the spider and bone for the skeleton.

The character had a health bar that looked like the following image. As the character took damage, the health bar would decrease.
